# Reuters classification
A neural network that can categorize short business news messages called newswires. 
The dataset is a set of newswires published by Reuters in 1986. 
There are 46 categories (topics) into which each newswire can be placed. 

A program modifies the input data, creates and trains a neural network, and shows the data collected during training.
